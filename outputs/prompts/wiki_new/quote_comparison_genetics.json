    "CRISPR gene editing is a genetic engineering technique in molecular biology by which the genomes of living organisms may be modified.",
    " Cas9 enzymes together with CRISPR sequences form the basis of a technology known as CRISPR-Cas9 that can be used to edit genes within organisms.",
    "Guide RNAs (a.k.a. gRNA, sgRNA) are the RNAs that guide the insertion or deletion of uridine residues into mitochondrial mRNAs in kinetoplastid protists in a process known as RNA editing.",
    "Off-target genome editing refers to nonspecific and unintended genetic modifications that can arise through the use of engineered nuclease technologies such as: clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9, transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALEN), meganucleases, and zinc finger nucleases (ZFN).",
    "CRISPR-Cas9 can be used to edit the DNA of organisms in vivo and to eliminate individual genes or even entire chromosomes from an organism at any point in its development.",
    "Gene drives may provide a powerful tool to restore balance of ecosystems by eliminating invasive species.",
    " When utilized for genome editing, this system includes Cas9, crRNA, and tracrRNA along with an optional section of DNA repair template that is utilized in either non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or homology directed repair (HDR).",
    "Genetic engineering as method of introducing new genetic elements into organisms has been around since the 1970s.",
    "CRISPRi can silence a target gene of interest up to 99.9% repression.",
    "Genetic engineering has many applications to medicine that include the manufacturing of drugs, creation of model animals that mimic human conditions and gene therapy.",
    " Additional studies regarding the kinetics of Cas9 have shown engineered Cas9 to be effective in reducing off-target effects by modifying the rate of the reaction.",
    "CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) is one type of CRISPR tool that use modified versions of dCas9, a mutation of Cas9 without endonuclease activity, with added transcriptional activators on dCas9 or the guide RNAs (gRNAs).",
    " This region is important for the regulation of translation of a transcript by differing mechanisms in viruses, prokaryotes and eukaryotes.",
    " As gene therapy is an emerging field, GUIDE-Seq has gained traction as a cheap method to detect the off-target effects of potential therapeutics without needing whole genome sequencing.",
    "The girls' parents were participants in a clinical project run by He, in which he offered standard in vitro fertilization services and in addition, used CRISPR-Cas9, a technology that can modify DNA, to modify the CCR5 gene in the embryos that were generated, to attempt to confer genetic resistance to HIV.",
    "CRISPR-Display (CRISP-Disp) is a modification of the CRISPR/Cas9 (Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) system for genome editing.",
    "Anti-CRISPR systems were first seen in Pseudomonas aeruginosa prophages, which disabled type I-F CRISPR–Cas system, characteristic of some strains of these bacteria.",
    "In 2014 Esvelt and coworkers first suggested that CRISPR/Cas9 might be used to build endonuclease gene drives.",
    "Protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) is a 2-6 base pair DNA sequence immediately following the DNA sequence targeted by the Cas9 nuclease in the CRISPR bacterial adaptive immune system.",
    "A gene knockout (abbreviation: KO) is a genetic technique in which one of an organism's genes is made inoperative (\"knocked out\" of the organism).",
    "Population genetics is a subfield of genetics that deals with genetic differences within and between populations, and is a part of evolutionary biology.",
    "Classical genetics is the branch of genetics based solely on visible results of reproductive acts.",
    "Genetic engineering, also called genetic modification or genetic manipulation, is the direct manipulation of an organism's genes using biotechnology.",
    " In the field of genetics, it aids in sequencing and annotating genomes and their observed mutations.",
    " Chromosome anomalies usually occur when there is an error in cell division following meiosis or mitosis.",
    "Gene expression is the process by which information from a gene is used in the synthesis of a functional gene product.",
    "In biology, epigenetics is the study of heritable phenotype changes that do not involve alterations in the DNA sequence.",
    "Molecular genetics is a sub-field of genetics that applies an \"investigative approach\" to determine the structure and/or function of genes in an organism’s genome using genetic screens.",
    "Quantitative genetics is a branch of population genetics that deals with phenotypes that vary continuously (in characters such as height or mass)—as opposed to discretely identifiable phenotypes and gene-products (such as eye-colour, or the presence of a particular biochemical).",
    "Medical genetics is the branch of medicine that involves the diagnosis and management of hereditary disorders.",
    "The field of neurogenetics emerged from advances made in molecular biology, genetics and a desire to understand the link between genes, behavior, the brain, and neurological disorders and diseases.",
    "Immunogenetics or immungenetics is the branch of medical genetics that explores the relationship between the immune system and genetics.",
    "Population genetics is a subfield of genetics that deals with genetic differences within and between populations, and is a part of evolutionary biology.",
