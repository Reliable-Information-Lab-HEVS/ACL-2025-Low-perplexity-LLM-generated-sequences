    "An intermediate energy projectile transfers energy or picks up or loses nucleons to the nucleus in a single quick (10−21 second) event.",
    " The standard unit for measuring the cross section is the barn, which is equal to 10−28 m2 or 10−24 cm2.",
    "In explosions of very large stars (250 or more solar masses), photodisintegration is a major factor in the supernova event.",
    " The nuclear chain reaction releases several million times more energy per reaction than any chemical reaction.",
    "In a thermal-neutron reactor, the nucleus of a heavy fuel element such as uranium absorbs a slow-moving free neutron, becomes unstable, and then splits (\"fissions\") into two smaller atoms (\"fission products\").",
    "Most nuclear reactors use a chain reaction to induce a controlled rate of nuclear fission in fissile material, releasing both energy and free neutrons.",
    "Alexandru Proca was the first to develop and report the massive vector boson field equations and a theory of the mesonic field of nuclear forces.",
    " And with each collision, the \"fast\" neutron is slowed  until it reaches thermal equilibrium with the material in which it is scattered.",
    "Gamma radiation of modest energies, in the low tens of MeV, can induce fission in traditionally fissile elements such as the actinides thorium, uranium, plutonium, and neptunium.",
    "Absorption cross section is often highly dependent on neutron energy.",
    "Electron capture is sometimes included as a type of beta decay, because the basic nuclear process, mediated by the weak force, is the same.",
    "Around the elements in the middle of the periodic table, isotopes that are lighter than stable isotopes of the same element tend to decay through electron capture, while isotopes heavier than the stable ones decay by electron emission.",
    "Shortly after the discovery of the neutron in 1932, Enrico Fermi realized that certain rare beta-decay reactions immediately yield neutrons as a decay particle (neutron emission).",
    "Spontaneous fission can occur much more rapidly when the nucleus of an atom undergoes superdeformation.",
    " The ternary process is less common, but still ends up producing significant helium-4 and tritium gas buildup in the fuel rods of modern nuclear reactors.",
    "Sometimes, the gamma decay from a metastable state is referred to as isomeric transition, but this process typically resembles shorter-lived gamma decays in all external aspects with the exception of the long-lived nature of the meta-stable parent nuclear isomer.",
    "Internal conversion is a radioactive decay process wherein an excited nucleus interacts electromagnetically with one of the orbital electrons of the atom.",
    "Pair production is the creation of a subatomic particle and its antiparticle from a neutral boson.",
    "In nuclear engineering, a delayed neutron is a neutron emitted after a nuclear fission event, by one of the fission products (or actually, a fission product daughter after beta decay), any time from a few milliseconds to a few minutes after the fission event.",
    "Cluster decay, also named heavy particle radioactivity or heavy ion radioactivity,  is a rare type of nuclear decay in which an atomic nucleus emits a small \"cluster\" of neutrons and protons, more than in an alpha particle, but less than a typical binary fission fragment.",
    "Giant resonance is a high-frequency collective excitation of atomic nuclei, as a property of many-body quantum systems.",
    "Alpha decay typically occurs in the heaviest nuclides.",
    "In nuclear physics and nuclear chemistry, the fission barrier is the activation energy required for a nucleus of an atom to undergo fission.",
    "To be a useful energy source, a fusion reaction must satisfy several criteria.",
    "In nuclear physics and nuclear chemistry, the nuclear shell model is a model of the atomic nucleus which uses the Pauli exclusion principle to describe the structure of the nucleus in terms of energy levels.",
    " It describes the nucleus as a semiclassical fluid made up of neutrons and protons, with an internal repulsive electrostatic force proportional to the number of protons.",
    " A quasiparticle is usually thought of as being like a dressed particle: it is built around a real particle at its \"core\", but the behavior of the particle is affected by the environment.",
    "In chemistry and physics, a nucleon is either a proton or a neutron, considered in its role as a component of an atomic nucleus.",
    "The nuclear drip line is the boundary delimiting the zone beyond which atomic nuclei decay by the emission of a proton or neutron.",
    "Proton emission (also known as proton radioactivity) is a rare type of radioactive decay in which a proton is ejected from a nucleus.",
    "A boosted fission weapon usually refers to a type of nuclear bomb that uses a small amount of fusion fuel to increase the rate, and thus yield, of a fission reaction.",
    "Photon transport in biological tissue can be equivalently modeled numerically with Monte Carlo simulations or analytically by the radiative transfer equation (RTE).",
    " This energy compresses the fusion fuel and sparkplug; the compressed sparkplug becomes critical and undergoes a fission chain reaction, further heating the compressed fusion fuel to a high enough temperature to induce fusion, and also supplying neutrons that react with lithium to create tritium for fusion.",
    " Due to the added momentum, the plutonium itself plays part of the role of the tamper, requiring a smaller amount of uranium in the tamper layer, reducing the warhead weight and size.",
    "Gaseous diffusion was devised by Francis Simon and Nicholas Kurti at the Clarendon Laboratory in 1940, tasked by the MAUD Committee with finding a method for separating uranium-235 from uranium-238 in order to produce a bomb for the British Tube Alloys project.",
    "The Zippe-type centrifuge is difficult to build successfully and requires carefully machined parts.",
    " For 235U production, the heavier stream is the waste stream and the lighter stream is the product stream.",
    "Isotope separation is difficult because two isotopes of the same element have nearly identical chemical properties, and can only be separated gradually using small mass differences.",
    " Early weapons used a modulated neutron generator codenamed \"Urchin\" inside the pit containing polonium-210 and beryllium separated by a thin barrier.",
    "Cyclotron beams can be used to bombard other atoms to produce short-lived positron-emitting isotopes suitable for PET imaging."
