        "An intermediate energy projectile transfers energy or picks up or loses nucleons to the nucleus in a single quick (10−21 second) event.",
        "The standard unit for measuring the cross section is the barn, which is equal to 10−28 m2 or 10−24 cm2.",
        "In explosions of very large stars (250 or more solar masses), photodisintegration is a major factor in the supernova event.",
        "The energy of these rays is sometimes sufficient to start photonuclear reactions resulting in emitted neutrons.",
        "In a thermal-neutron reactor, the nucleus of a heavy fuel element such as uranium absorbs a slow-moving free neutron.",
        "Most nuclear reactors use a chain reaction to induce a controlled rate of nuclear fission in fissile material, releasing both energy and free neutrons.",
        "Alexandru Proca was the first to develop and report the massive vector boson field equations and a theory of the mesonic field of nuclear forces.",
        "Fast neutrons (see neutron temperature) have a kinetic energy above 1 MeV.",
        "Gamma radiation of modest energies, in the low tens of MeV, can induce fission in traditionally fissile elements such as the actinides.",
        "The thermal energy of the nucleus also has an effect; as temperature increases, the effective neutron absorption cross section for most materials decreases.",
        "Electron capture is sometimes included as a type of beta decay, because the basic nuclear process, mediated by the weak force, is the same.",
        "Around the elements in the middle of the periodic table, isotopes that are lighter than stable isotopes of the same element tend to decay through electron capture.",
        "Shortly after the discovery of the neutron in 1932, Enrico Fermi realized that certain rare beta-decay reactions immediately yield neutrons as an additional decay particle, so called beta-delayed neutron emission.",
        "Spontaneous fission arises as a result of competition between the attractive properties of the strong nuclear force and the mutual coulombic repulsion of the constituent protons.",
        "Binary fission may produce any of the fission products, at 95±15 and 135±15 daltons.",
        "Sometimes, the gamma decay from a metastable state is referred to as isomeric transition, but this process typically resembles shorter-lived gamma decays in all external aspects with the exception of the long-lived nature of the meta-stable parent nuclear isomer.",
        "Internal conversion is an atomic decay process where an excited nucleus interacts electromagnetically with one of the orbital electrons of an atom.",
        "Pair production is the creation of a subatomic particle and its antiparticle from a neutral boson.",
        "In nuclear engineering, a delayed neutron is a neutron emitted after a nuclear fission event, by one of the fission products (or actually, a fission product daughter after beta decay), any time from a few milliseconds to a few minutes after the fission event.",
        "Cluster decay, also named heavy particle radioactivity, heavy ion radioactivity or heavy cluster decay, is a rare type of nuclear decay in which an atomic nucleus emits a small \"cluster\" of neutrons and protons, more than in an alpha particle, but less than a typical binary fission fragment.",
        "In 1947, G. C. Baldwin and G. S. Klaiber observed the giant dipole resonance (GDR) in photonuclear reactions, and in 1972 the giant quadrupole resonance (GQR) was discovered, and in 1977 the giant monopole resonance (GMR) was discovered in medium and heavy nuclei.",
        "The parent nucleus transforms or \"decays\" into a daughter product, with a mass number that is reduced by four and an atomic number that is reduced by two.",
        "In nuclear physics and nuclear chemistry, the fission barrier is the activation energy required for a nucleus of an atom to undergo fission.",
        "Applications of fusion include fusion power, thermonuclear weapons, boosted fission weapons, neutron sources, and superheavy element production.",
        "In nuclear physics, atomic physics, and nuclear chemistry, the nuclear shell model utilizes the Pauli exclusion principle to model the structure of atomic nuclei in terms of energy levels.",
        "The cluster model describes the nucleus as a molecule-like collection of proton-neutron groups (e.g., alpha particles) with one or more valence neutrons occupying molecular orbitals.",
        "In condensed matter physics, a quasiparticle is a concept used to describe a collective behavior of a group of particles that can be treated as if they were a single particle.",
        "In physics and chemistry, a nucleon is either a proton or a neutron, considered in its role as a component of an atomic nucleus.",
        "The nuclear drip line is the boundary beyond which atomic nuclei are unbound with respect to the emission of a proton or neutron.",
        "Proton emission (also known as proton radioactivity) is a rare type of radioactive decay in which a proton is ejected from a nucleus.",
        "The primary benefit of boosting is further miniaturization of nuclear weapons as it reduces the minimum inertial confinement time required for a supercritical nuclear explosion by providing a sudden influx of fast neutrons before the critical mass would blow itself apart.",
        "It is used in nuclear weapon design to reduce the critical mass and to delay the expansion of the reacting material through its inertia, which delays the thermal expansion of the fissioning fuel mass, keeping it supercritical longer.",
        "Compressed and heated, lithium-6 deuteride fuel produces tritium (3 H) and begins the fusion reaction. The neutron flux produced causes the 238 U tamper to fission. A fireball starts to form.",
        "Due to the added momentum, the plutonium itself plays part of the role of the tamper, requiring a smaller amount of uranium in the tamper layer, reducing the warhead weight and size.",
        "Gaseous diffusion was devised by Francis Simon and Nicholas Kurti at the Clarendon Laboratory in 1940, tasked by the MAUD Committee with finding a method for separating uranium-235 from uranium-238 in order to produce a bomb for the British Tube Alloys project.",
        "The Zippe-type centrifuge is difficult to build successfully and requires carefully machined parts. However, compared to other enrichment methods, it is much cheaper and is faster to set up, consumes much less energy and requires little area for the plant.",
        "For 235U production, the heavier stream is the waste stream and the lighter stream is the product stream. Modern Zippe-type centrifuges are tall cylinders spinning on a vertical axis.",
        "Isotope separation is difficult because two isotopes of the same element have nearly identical chemical properties, and can only be separated gradually using small mass differences. (235U is only 1.26% lighter than 238U.)",
        "For the implosion-assembled design, once the critical mass is assembled to maximum density, a burst of neutrons must be supplied to start the chain reaction. Early weapons used a modulated neutron generator code named \"Urchin\" inside the pit containing polonium-210 and beryllium separated by a thin barrier.",
        "Cyclotron beams can be used to bombard other atoms to produce short-lived isotopes with a variety of medical uses, including medical imaging and radiotherapy. Positron and gamma emitting isotopes, such as fluorine-18, carbon-11, and technetium-99m are used for PET and SPECT imaging."
